So just doing an observation from the front. So what we're looking at here are the feet,  pronated, are they supernated? Is there any balgus or verus at the knees? Is there any sort of,  movement that then translates into the hips? Does that mean that they're overly abducted or abducted?, ,  Can you see any sort of torsion at the hips? Any changes in muscle boat from the front as well?,  Can we see any sort of changes in the line of the pelvis from the front of this point of view?, ,  Can we see any changes or abnormalities in the abdomen or really problems with the muscles of the,  transverse abdominis or the rectus of abdominis? Can we see any sort of changes in pectissia or,  anything like that? Is there any difference in alignment at the shoulder level as well? Is there any sort,  of neck deformities in the lateral flexion that we're doing for that? Right. Okay. I'm going from the,  side. So from the side, I'm just looking at to see if there's any particular angle that the feet,  might be pointing at is when it is as we move up, there's a scene to be any differences in the angle,  and the poppitorial angle at the back of the knee. There's a scene to be any posterior anterior tilt.,  Is there any differences in the angle at the shoulder? Does there seem to be any excessive,  lordosis in the lumbar spine or is there any excessive chyphosis in the thoracic spine?, ,  Is there any excessive chyphosis in the spine also? And then from the back, again looking at any,  particular angles, can we see any supination or prognation at the feet? Can we see any changes in,  the Achilles tendon area or muscle bulk of the calves? Can we see any changes in tilt at the hips?, ,  Is there any, again, this angle you might be able to see if there's any posterior hand,  to do a tilt, but you might be able to see if there's any sort of lateral tilt as well?,  Is there any changes in muscle bulk in the lower back? Running up the erectus spimer into the,  lats into the trapezius into the rhombus? Does there seem to be any change in level, the level of,  the scapula?

This decision is influenced by the high likelihood of occurrence for most unknown factors, including 'actions completeness' and 'muscle bulk changes in lower back'. Additionally, the discussion around 'schrober examination' suggests that a detailed and thorough assessment of the student's performance is necessary. A brief action will allow the teacher to quickly identify the strengths and weaknesses of each student without being bogged down by unnecessary details.\n\nIn terms of grades, I expect the teacher to award an average grade for most students, with some possibly receiving a good grade if their performance is exceptional. The brief nature of the action will allow the teacher to make quick judgments about each student's work, taking into account factors such as 'pronated, supernated' and 'balanced posture'. The discussion around 'abnormal alignment' suggests that some students may have issues with proper posture, which would affect their grades.\n\nOverall, a brief action is the most appropriate course of action given the high likelihood of occurrence for many unknown factors. It will allow the teacher to efficiently assess each student's performance and provide timely feedback.\"\n} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"
