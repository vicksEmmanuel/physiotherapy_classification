In contrast, the 'brief' grade is less affected by these factors, as it only requires a cursory glance at the patient's posture and does not require detailed analysis of muscle bulk or potential injuries. Additionally, the discussion accompanying the 'brief' grade focuses more on general observations rather than specific details.
