Below are the grades I am considering: brief, good. I would like to know which grade I should give based on the actions and discussions used to analyse their patients.
        I can only choose one grade.
        Below are the information about grade brief (i.e. brief).

Actions: 
Discussions:  Looking at the front of the patients, just looking at the posture, generally, any swelling,  and the knee, the muscle bulk, any potential injuries.,  The side, just looking at the pelvis, the rear, just looking at the back and the spine,, ,  and that's it, I think I'll go on.,

Below are the information about grade good (i.e. good).

Actions: schrober examination
Discussions:  Right. So just doing an observation from the front. So what we're looking at here are the feet,  pronated, are they supernated? Is there any balgus or verus at the knees? Is there any sort of,  movement that then translates into the hips? Does that mean that they're overly abducted or abducted?, ,  Can you see any sort of torsion at the hips? Any changes in muscle boat from the front as well?,  Can we see any sort of changes in the line of the pelvis from the front of this point of view?, ,  Can we see any changes or abnormalities in the abdomen or really problems with the muscles of the,  transverse abdominis or the rectus of abdominis? Can we see any sort of changes in pectissia or,  anything like that? Is there any difference in alignment at the shoulder level as well? Is there any sort,  of neck deformities in the lateral flexion that we're doing for that? Right. Okay. I'm going from the,  side. So from the side, I'm just looking at to see if there's any particular angle that the feet,  might be pointing at is when it is as we move up, there's a scene to be any differences in the angle,  and the poppitorial angle at the back of the knee. There's a scene to be any posterior anterior tilt.,  Is there any differences in the angle at the shoulder? Does there seem to be any excessive,  lordosis in the lumbar spine or is there any excessive chyphosis in the thoracic spine?, ,  Is there any excessive chyphosis in the spine also? And then from the back, again looking at any,  particular angles, can we see any supination or prognation at the feet? Can we see any changes in,  the Achilles tendon area or muscle bulk of the calves? Can we see any changes in tilt at the hips?, ,  Is there any, again, this angle you might be able to see if there's any posterior hand,  to do a tilt, but you might be able to see if there's any sort of lateral tilt as well?,  Is there any changes in muscle bulk in the lower back? Running up the erectus spimer into the,  lats into the trapezius into the rhombus? Does there seem to be any change in level, the level of,  the scapula? Also, is there sort of any changes or differences, unilateral differences in trapezius?,  And again, any sort of changes in bulk around the levels of the neck as well and other shoulders,  level as well? There we are.,

I'm a physiotherapy teacher grading students' based on the actions and discussioned used to analyse their patients.

Below are the actions I can take:
Action 1. brief
Action 2. good



I would like to know which action I should take based on the information provided above.
You should format your response as a JSON object. The JSON object should contain the following keys:
- decision: a string that describes the action you recommend the phsiotherapy_teacher to take. The output format should be the same as the format of the actions listed above, e.g. Action 1. brief
- explanation: a string that describes, in detail, the reasoning behind your decision. You should include information on the expected actions and discussion of each grade, as well as factors that affect them.
